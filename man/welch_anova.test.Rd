\usage{
welch_anova.test(levels, n, means, sd, effsize = "AnL")
}
\arguments{
\item{levels}{Vector with level names of the independent variable}

\item{n}{Vector with sample size for each level}

\item{means}{Vector with sample mean for each level}

\item{sd}{Vector with sample standard deviation for each level}

\item{effsize}{Options "AnL" (standard), "Kirk", "CaN" (see below)}
}
\value{
A list of class "wAnova" that contains the F-value, df-between, df-within,
p-value and effect size omega-squared that can later be converted to a
table-styled summary using summary()

The adjusted omega squared estimator of the effect size is either calculated by the formula
of of Albers and Lakens, Kirk or Caroll and Nordholm (Further notes see README file)
