)
}
\arguments{
\item{means}{Vector of means for each group.}

\item{sd}{Vector of standard deviations for each group.}

\item{n}{Vector of sample sizes for each group.}

\item{n_sim}{Number of simulations to perform. Defaults to 1000.}

\item{sim_func}{Function used for generating random samples. Defaults to rnorm().}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for normality and homoscedasticity tests. Defaults to 0.05.}

\item{adj}{Logical, if TRUE applies continuity correction for proportions. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list of class "simres" containing the proportion of simulations where
residuals are normally distributed and homoscedastic.
}
\description{
Monte Carlo simulation to assess residual normality and homoscedasticity
across multiple groups by generating simulated data based on provided means,
standard deviations, and sample sizes.
